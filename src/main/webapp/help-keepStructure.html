<div>Keep relative structure for folders
    Keeps behavior that was introduced in first version of 0.9.
    Imagine that you have simple structure:
    <pre>
        tests
        -- a
        ---- results
        -- b
        ---- results
    </pre>
    If you specifed tests/* as a parameters, plugin will upload it to tests/a/results...tests/b/results.
    If this checkbox is disabled, plugin will upload it as a/results...b/results.
